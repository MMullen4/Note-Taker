# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

The application is called Note Taker and can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves data from a db.json file.

## Visuals
http://localhost:3001/notes

<../../../Note Taker screen.pdf>
## Installation
None

## Usage
Existing notes are listed in the left-hand column with empty fields on the right-hand side for the new noteâ€™s title and text.  Enter your title, tab down to the notes and then click save in the upper right.  Deletion is not yet supported (working on it though).

## Support

* `GET /api/notes` should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

* `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
